However pain is highly susceptible to endogenous modulation, raising the possibility that active or passive changes in neural activity provoked by the operation of the system could enhance or interfere with the signals upon which it is based. We studied healthy subjects receiving intermittent pain stimuli in a real-time fMRI-based closed-loop feedback-stimulation task. We showed that multi-voxel pattern decoding of pain intensity could be used to train a control algorithm to learn to deliver less painful stimuli (adaptive decoded neurofeedback). However, the system engaged two types of endogenous processes in the brain. First, despite the inherent incentive for subjects to enhance the neural decodability of pain, decodability was either reduced or unchanged in classic pain-processing regions, including insula, dorsolateral prefrontal, and somatosensory cortices. However, increased decodability was observed in a putative pain modulatory region - the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC). Second, we found that pain perception itself was modulated by an endogenous computational uncertainty signal engaged as subjects learned the success rate of the system in reducing pain - an effect that also correlated with pgACC responses. The results illustrate how regionally and computationally specific co-adaptive brain-machine learning influences the efficacy of closed-loop systems for pain, and shows that pgACC acts as a key hub in the endogenous controllability of pain.","tags":null,"title":"Endogenous controllability of closed-loop brain-machine interfaces for pain.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luke R.

Although a central role for the amygdala is well established [4], both human and animal studies implicate other brain regions in learning, notably ventral striatum and cerebellum [5]. It remains unclear whether these regions make different contributions to a single aversive learning process or represent independent learning mechanisms that interact to generate the expression of pain-related behavior. We designed a human parallel aversive conditioning paradigm in which different Pavlovian visual cues probabilistically predicted thermal pain primarily to either the left or right arm and studied the acquisition of conditioned Pavlovian responses using combined physiological recordings and fMRI. Using computational modeling based on reinforcement learning theory, we found that conditioning involves two distinct types of learning process. First, a non-specific “preparatory” system learns aversive facial expressions and autonomic responses such as skin conductance. The associated learning signals—the learned associability and prediction error—were correlated with fMRI brain responses in amygdala-striatal regions, corresponding to the classic aversive (fear) learning circuit. Second, a specific lateralized system learns “consummatory” limb-withdrawal responses, detectable with electromyography of the arm to which pain is predicted. Its related learned associability was correlated with responses in ipsilateral cerebellar cortex, suggesting a novel computational role for the cerebellum in pain. In conclusion, our results show that the overall phenotype of conditioned pain behavior depends on two dissociable reinforcement learning circuits.","tags":null,"title":"Dissociable Learning Processes Underlie Human Pain Conditioning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Harry Barber","Hiroaki Mano","Suyi Zhang","Nobuhiro Hagura","Patrick Haggard","Martin Koltzenburg","Ben Seymour"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"987efc5875cee4dad65a97d27945654c","permalink":"https://syzhang.github.io/publication/barber-thermal-2015/","publishdate":"2019-12-23T13:27:46.716602Z","relpermalink":"/publication/barber-thermal-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Thermal interfaces: reduction in discriminative accuracy despite enhanced subjective confidence after topical application of menthol.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Suyi Zhang","Ben Seymour"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1411344000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1411344000,"objectID":"63624e83433b4656720655af66f906c2","permalink":"https://syzhang.github.io/publication/zhang-technology-2014/","publishdate":"2019-12-23T13:27:46.706618Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-technology-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Technology developed for chronic pain management has been fast evolving and offers new stand-alone prospects for the diagnosis and treatment of pain, rather than simply addressing the limitations of pharmacology-based approaches.
